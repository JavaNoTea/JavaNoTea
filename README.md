## Experience

**VP of Eventual Alignment** at *Null Object Syndicate*, where I pioneered backwards compatibility with the future. Architect of the “It Works On My Machine” certification standard (ISO 409: Teammate Blame Protocol). 

Previously served as **Staff Engineer of Obscure Internal Tools** at *Definitely Not Google*, where I was responsible for maintaining a build system so complex it gained sentience and filed its own PTO. Led a tiger team of one in shipping `leftpad++`, a quantum-safe string alignment utility no one asked for but everyone feared.

Successfully rewrote 40,000 lines of legacy code into a single unreadable `.sh` file. Promoted immediately.

### Jokes aside...

I'm a master's student at UCF specializing in AI and Machine Learning, with research spanning explainable reinforcement learning, causal models, GNNs, and creative AI systems like text-to-MIDI generation. I love building cool, smart things that work.
