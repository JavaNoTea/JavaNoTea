## Welcome

Hi, I’m Christian King, a graduate researcher and engineer focused on artificial intelligence and machine learning. My work spans neural data compression, adversarial robustness, model alignment, and generative systems.

I’m currently completing my master’s in Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida, graduating in July 2025. I recently wrapped up a research collaboration with the Air Force Research Laboratory, where I worked on interpretable reinforcement learning and efficient neural representations.

My approach blends research depth with engineering precision. I build systems that are technically rigorous and practically useful, whether that means simulating traffic patterns with GNNs or aligning large language models with human preferences.

## Selected Projects

### Lexical Lullabies  
Text-to-MIDI generation using LLaMA on paired symbolic music and natural language. Built a multimodal training pipeline to align musical structure with textual intent.

### TraffiCast
Bidirectional graph neural network for highway traffic prediction. Designed dynamic edge weighting and directional flow modeling using over a decade of geospatial volume data.

### BuildANeural.net
A drag-and-drop neural architecture builder with real-time PyTorch code generation. Built with React, Next.js, FastAPI, and Docker. Supports 20+ layer types with a modular interface.

### Audio Encoder and LLM Alignment  
Extended a preference optimization framework to align speech-to-text LLMs with human ratings. Improved performance across ASR and QA tasks through multi-stage finetuning.

### DnD Dice Classifier  
YOLO and ResNet-based system for identifying physical dice from video streams. Constructed and augmented a custom dataset for robust training and evaluation.

## About Me

I enjoy working at the intersection of systems research and applied AI. I value clarity, thoughtful design, and reproducibility. My portfolio includes everything from exploratory prototypes to full-stack deployed tools.

Good engineering, to me, is a mix of curiosity, rigor, and iteration. I’m always interested in collaborating on technically challenging and meaningful projects.
